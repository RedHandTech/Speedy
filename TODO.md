- Better documentation. Look at making .io website through GitHub otherwise do docs one class / item per page and then master README have links and a setup blurb. Document code and it will appear in Cocoapods
- History class. See n number of changes to a value
- Undo management. Integration with History class to perform rollbacks. Make it really easy.
- Make everything as easy as possible. Operator overloads etc. E.g. ~> to access the value property directly.
- Make value.every stoppable. At the moment a user cannot stop the tick once triggered.
